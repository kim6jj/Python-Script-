<h2>Python Script<h2>

<p>This is a python script I wrote in college for my Programming Languages class. This was a part of a series of 3 projects dedicated to learning new languages with each successive project being extended off the one before in a new language. In this project (first of 3, next two being Scheme and Prolog), the script reads a text filed provided through the terminal which in turn list cities (1 per line) in a format accepted by the Google Maps API. The program then must form a query to obtain a distance matrix with these cities used as both origins an destinations. It then submits the query to obtain the results in the form of an XML string and the script parses this to extract the data and outputs to terminal. The data is outputted in the following fashion: origin city, destination city, distance in Kilometers, then a newline. Distance values are in integer values and no distance from a city to itself will be shown.<p>
